"Zero-day vulnerabilities (“zero-day exploits”, or just “zero-days”) are exploitable vulnerabilities 
that a software vendor is not aware of and for which no patch has been created. Zero-days 
are thus desirable for hackers, because everyone is vulnerable to exploitation. This, combined 
with zero-days being difficult to find and difficult to develop an exploit for, makes them pricy. 
Zero-days are most often thought to be used for corporate espionage, or highly targeted attacks 
where the only entry is through a zero-day",,,,,http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR600/RR610/RAND_RR610.pdf,,
